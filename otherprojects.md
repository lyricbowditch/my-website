# Other Projects

## New Jersey Millionaires Tax

As a National Fellow at the Scholars Strategy Network, Lyric coordinated a series of economists group letters advising state and federal policymakers on how to balance budgets during the Covid-19 pandemic without drastic cuts to spending, which would disproportionately harm those who had already been most affected by the pandemic. This project played a crucial role in New Jersey's adoption of a groundbreaking millionaire's tax in September 2020.
