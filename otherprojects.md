## New Jersey Millionaires Tax

As a National Fellow at the Scholars Strategy Network, Lyric coordinated a series of economists group letters advising state and federal policymakers on balancing budgets during the pandemic, which played a crucial role in New Jersey's adoption of a groundbreaking millionaire's tax in September 2020.

## <i>The Columbia Daily Spectator</i>

As a student at Barnard College, Lyric ran <i>The Eye</i> magazine at <i>The Columbia Daily Spectator</i>. As editor, she managed and closely mentored a staff of 30 investigative long-form writers and associate editors; developed and ran an intensive, semester-long training program for 20 incoming <i>Eye</i> trainees; provided structural and sentence-level edits on a total of 36 articles (ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 words); and liaised with the other sections of <i>Spectator</i> to coordinate diverse media components. She also wrote eight long-form articles, including a 4,570-word cover story that sparked an official change in Barnard’s transfer credit acceptance policy for American Sign Language courses.
