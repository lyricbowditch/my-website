## House of SpeakEasy

Lyric is currently the <b>Executive Producer</b> at House of SpeakEasy — a nonprofit that champions reading, writing, and public participation in literary culture. In her role as Executive Producer, Lyric leads the team behind the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/books/its-not-a-reading-its-literary-cabaret.html">critically-acclaimed</a> literary cabaret series <i>Seriously Entertaining</i>. Each month, <i>Seriously Entertaining</i> brings together four incredible writers for a night of live storytelling at Joe's Pub at The Public Theater. Lyric works closely with the writers — including Bill Buford, Junot Díaz, Mary Gaitskill, Yiyun Li, ZZ Packer, Gary Shteyngart, and many more — to develop engaging talks. Collaborations include <i>The New Yorker</i>, Knopf Publishing, Association of Marshall Scholars, and World Monuments Fund.

## New Jersey Millionaires Tax

As a National Fellow at the Scholars Strategy Network, Lyric coordinated a series of economists group letters advising state and federal policymakers on how to balance budgets during the Covid-19 pandemic without drastic cuts to spending, which would disproportionately harm those who had already been most affected by the pandemic. This project played a crucial role in New Jersey's adoption of a millionaire's tax in September 2020.

## <i>The Columbia Daily Spectator</i>

As a student at Barnard College, Lyric ran <i>The Eye</i> magazine at <i>The Columbia Daily Spectator</i>. <b>As editor, she managed and closely mentored a staff of 30 investigative long-form writers and associate editors</b>; developed and ran an intensive, semester-long training program for 20 incoming <i>Eye</i> trainees; provided structural and sentence-level edits on a total of 36 articles (ranging from 1,500 to 4,000 words); and liaised with the other sections of <i>Spectator</i> to coordinate diverse media components. She also wrote eight long-form articles, including a 4,570-word cover story that sparked an official change in Barnard’s transfer credit acceptance policy for American Sign Language courses.
