## House of SpeakEasy

Lyric is currently the <b>Executive Producer</b> at House of SpeakEasy — a nonprofit grounded in the belief that the ability to read and write enables a person to know their rights, be confident in their identity, and engage boldly and empathetically with the world around them. In her role as Executive Producer, Lyric leads the team behind the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/books/its-not-a-reading-its-literary-cabaret.html">critically-acclaimed</a> literary cabaret series <i>Seriously Entertaining</i>. Each month, <i>Seriously Entertaining</i> brings together four incredible writers for a night of live storytelling at Joe's Pub at The Public Theater. Lyric works closely with the writers — including Bill Buford, Junot Díaz, Mary Gaitskill, Yiyun Li, ZZ Packer, Gary Shteyngart, and many more — to develop engaging talks. Collaborations include <i>The New Yorker</i>, Knopf Publishing, Association of Marshall Scholars, and World Monuments Fund.
