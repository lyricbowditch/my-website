# About

Lyric Bowditch is a Brooklyn-based podcast producer and editor with a passion for bringing stories to life through audio. She produced both weekly conversation podcasts and multi-voice narrative shows at the Freakonomics Radio Network for four years, including developing a new series from start to finish. She also served as the Freakonomics Radio Network's video editor. 

Lyric is voraciously curious and has produced stories on topics ranging from healthcare economics to canine cognition to behavioral science to women’s college tennis. She is experienced in both creative and technical aspects of podcast production — including ideation and development, booking and interviewing guests, prepping and managing hosts, sourcing archival tape, field recording, liaising with studios and tape syncs, scripting episodes, fact-checking, assembling mixes, and editing at all stages.

Lyric lived in Cairo, Egypt for ten years, from third grade through graduating high school. She went on to study comp lit and comp sci at Barnard College in New York City, where she served as editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator’s long-form magazine and helped launch the paper’s first podcast feed. When she’s not producing podcasts, there’s a good chance Lyric is listening to one while cooking, gardening, or training for her next marathon.
