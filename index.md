# About

<b>Lyric Bowditch is an independent podcast producer and editor</b> based in Brooklyn, NY. Current roles include producer for <i>HISTORY This Week</i>, <i>The Messy Parts</i>, and <i>On The Rise</i>; scriptwriter for <i>National Park After Dark</i>; and Executive Producer for House of SpeakEasy. She also provides independent podcast consulting, development, and production services — in addition to developing projects of her own. She is represented by Annabel Garcia Eller at The Gersh Agency. 

Previously, Lyric produced both weekly conversation podcasts and multi-voice narrative shows at the Freakonomics Radio Network for four years, including developing the limited series <i>Off Leash</i> — which was "highly recommended" by <i>The New Yorker</i> and one of CBC Radio's "best podcasts of 2022." She also served as the Freakonomics Radio Network's video editor. 

Lyric is voraciously curious and has produced stories on topics ranging from healthcare economics to canine cognition to behavioral science to women’s college tennis. <b>She is experienced in both creative and technical aspects of podcast production</b> — including ideation and development, booking and interviewing guests, prepping and managing hosts, sourcing archival tape, field recording, tape syncs, scripting, fact-checking, assembling mixes, editing at all stages, leading team meetings, and producing video.

Originally from Baltimore, Lyric grew up in Cairo, Egypt (2006-2016). She earned a B.A. in English/French comparative literature and a minor in computer science from Barnard College in New York City, where she served as editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator’s long-form magazine <i>The Eye</i>. When she’s not producing podcasts, there’s a good chance Lyric is listening to one while cooking, gardening, or training for her next marathon.
