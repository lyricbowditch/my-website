# About

<b>Lyric Bowditch is an independent podcast and live event producer</b> based in Brooklyn, NY. She is currently the Executive Producer at House of SpeakEasy, where she leads the team behind the critically-acclaimed literary cabaret series <i>Seriously Entertaining</i>. 

With a focus on storytelling, Lyric also executive produces keynote events for professional summits and offers independent podcast consulting, development, and production services. Her current podcast projects include a forthcoming series on election trust research for the University of California San Diego, as well as original audio journalism investigations of her own. She is represented by Annabel Garcia Eller at The Gersh Agency.

For four years, Lyric produced both weekly conversation podcasts and multi-voice narrative shows full time at the Freakonomics Radio Network, including developing the limited series <i>Off Leash</i> — which was "highly recommended" by <i>The New Yorker</i> and one of CBC Radio's "best podcasts of 2022."

Previous freelance roles include producer for <i>HISTORY This Week</i>, producer for <i>The Messy Parts Podcast</i>, and scriptwriter for <i>National Park After Dark</i>. 

Originally from Baltimore, Lyric grew up in Cairo, Egypt (2006-2016). She earned a B.A. in English/French comparative literature and a minor in computer science from Barnard College in New York City, where she served as editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator’s long-form magazine <i>The Eye</i>. When she’s not producing podcasts, there’s a good chance Lyric is listening to one while cooking, gardening, or training for her next marathon.
