# About

Lyric is a podcast producer with a background in long-form journalism and a passion for bringing stories to life through audio. She has years of experience producing both weekly conversation podcasts and multi-voice narrative shows at the Freakonomics Radio Network, including developing a new series from start to finish. She is also a skilled video producer. 

Lyric is voraciously curious and has worked on topics ranging from healthcare economics to canine cognition to behavioral science to women’s tennis. She is experienced in all aspects of podcast production, including episode ideation and development, booking and pre-interviewing guests, prepping and managing hosts, scripting episodes, sourcing archival tape, field recording, liaising with studios and tape syncs, fact-checking, soundtracking, and putting together/editing mixes. 

When she’s not producing podcasts, there’s a good chance Lyric is listening to one while cooking, gardening, or training for her next marathon.
